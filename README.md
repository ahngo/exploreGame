# exploreGame

Map-based game using pointers, classes and polymorphism written in C++. Randomly generates map tiles, map names and events that require player input in the form of a letter.

Sample text from game, note that the game requests a prompt whenever the console prints "Your choice: ".

You are an adventurer trapped in the Labyrinth of the Pursuer.
You have limited time to scavenge what items and power you can in the mysterious, everchanging Labyrinth.
You perish if your health hits zero. When time hits zero, the Pursuer will attack you. Each movement takes 1 Time. Each exploration takes 2 Time.
Navigate the map, events and your inventory (when possible) by entering keys when prompted (not case sensitive).
Good luck and may the mysteries of the Labyrinth reveal themselves to you.
